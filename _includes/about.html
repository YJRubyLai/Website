                    <p>I have given all my effort and passion to contribute to statistics and biostatistics for more than six years. I have strong theoretical basis in statistics, foundational concept of epidemiology and  adequate data analysis experience. I wish to contribute to workable solutions for current medical issues such as developing effective disease prognosis and novel genetic intervention for therapy. Moreover, I hope provide truly personalized precision healthcare and make a positive impact on the broader field of biostatistics.</p>
